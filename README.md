# Scraping-Mon-d-
This assignment was a work in progress that was not yet completed yet most of the functionality is already in place. It was an assignment intended to use MongoDB and Mongoose to Scrape certain information from the BBC website and display it to the user which would allow a quick and easy way to broswe the news and comment on the stories that they could edit save and that other people could view. Since it is incomplete the front end functionality was never finished and after spending more than 40 hours on the assignment I began to dedicate myself to the final project instead. I created a back end Database in Mongo to hold the pertinent information that I had scraped using functions from the BBC website that would then be posted to the webpage using mongoose and App.js. With the continued use of the MVC paradigm and the built in ORM it was much easier to design and create the necessary functionality for the app. 
Tools used: MVC paradigm, MongoDB, Node.js, App.js, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, NPM packages.
